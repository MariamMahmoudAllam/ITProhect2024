                Called the "Bride of the Mediterranean" internationally,
                Alexandria is a popular tourist destination and an important
                industrial centre due to its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez

                The city was founded originally in the vicinity of an Egyptian settlement
                named Rhacotis (that became the Egyptian quarter of the city).
                Alexandria grew rapidly, becoming a major centre of Hellenic civilisation
                and replacing Memphis as Egypt's capital during the reign of the
                Ptolemaic pharaohs who succeeded Alexander. It retained this status for
                almost a millennium, through the period of Roman and Eastern Roman rule
                until the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 641 AD, when a new capital was
                founded at Fustat (later absorbed into Cairo).

        <p class="para4">Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos), one of the Seven Wonders of
            the Ancient World; its Great Library, the largest in the ancient world; and the Catacombs of
            Kom El Shoqafa, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was the intellectual
            and cultural centre of the ancient Mediterranean for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity.
            It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome.</p>
        <div class="square6"> <p class="para5">The city was a major centre of early Christianity and was the centre of the
                            Patriarchate of Alexandria, which was one of the major centres of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire.
                            In the modern world, the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim
                            to this ancient heritage. By 641, the city had already been largely plundered and lost its significance
                            before re-emerging in the modern era. From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major centre
                            of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, both
                            because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the 
                            lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton</p>
